Example: demmo.py file in local repository

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

->Now we have made some changes in demoo.py file

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   demoo.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git diff
diff --git a/demoo.py b/demoo.py
