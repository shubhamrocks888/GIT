 	"CREATE A BRANCH FOR DESIRED FEATURE"

##	 git branch  --> list of all the branches in local repository

	$ git branch
	* master

	NOTE: '*' shows the branch at which we are currently in

##	git branch -a --> list of all the branches in local as well as remote repository

	$ git branch -a
	* master
  	remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  	remotes/origin/master

	NOTE: ../HEAD -> shows the branch at which we are currently in remote repository


##LITTILE DEMO PROJECT:

1.	git status

	$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   demoo.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

2.	So,modification is done in a demoo.py file.
	Let's create a branch for this:
	
	$ git branch calc-divide

3.	Lets go out to this calc-divide branch by:

	$ git checkout calc-divide
	Switched to branch 'calc-divide'
	M       demoo.py

4. 	Check the branch at which we are currently in:

	$ git branch
	* calc-divide
  	master

5.	Now,add these modifications at this branch;
	
	git add -A
	git commmit -m "divide func"

	Now,we have successfully committed our changes.but this has no effect on local master branch and
	remote repository.

6.	AFTER COMMIT PUSH BRANCH TO REMOTE: git push -u origin calc-divide

	NOTE: We are pushing first time this branch,thatswhy we have used u after push.
	      After that we can push like normally -> git push
	
	$ git push -u origin calc-divide

	remote:
	remote: Create a pull request for 'calc-divide' on GitHub by visiting:
	remote:      https://github.com/shubhamrocks888/python_practise/pull/new/calc-divide
	remote:
	To https://github.com/shubhamrocks888/python_practise.git
	 * [new branch]      calc-divide -> calc-divide
	Branch 'calc-divide' set up to track remote branch 'calc-divide' from 'origin'.

7.  	Now,check the branches:

	$ git branch -a
	* calc-divide
  	master
  	remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
 	remotes/origin/calc-divide
  	remotes/origin/master

	After being tested the calc-divide branch at repository.We can merge the branch 

8.	MERGE A CALC-DIVIDE BRANCH WITH MASTER:

	$ git checkout master
	Switched to branch 'master'
	branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

	Before we commit anything to master,we want to pull all the changes down in case
	any changes were made.

	$ git pull origin master
	From https://github.com/shubhamrocks888/python_practise
 	* branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
	Already up to date.

9.     git branch --merged ---> tell us about the branches that we are merged

	$  git branch --merged
	* master

	calc-divide doesnot show here,it means it has not been merged yet.

10.	Merge calc-divide branch with master:

	$ git merge calc-divide
	Updating 0783c7b..ecb9b86
	Fast-forward
 	demoo.py | 23 ++++-------------------
 	1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 19 deletions(-)

11.	Check the branch that is merged with master:

	$ git branch --merged
  	calc-divide
	* master

	Here,calc-divide has showed up.So,finally it has been merged with master.

12.	Push the master branch to remote repository:

	$ git push origin master
	Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
	To https://github.com/shubhamrocks888/python_practise.git
   	0783c7b..ecb9b86  master -> master

13. 	Now,we are done with calc-divide branch:

	$ git branch -a
  	calc-divide
	* master
  	remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  	remotes/origin/calc-divide
  	remotes/origin/master
	
	DELETE A BRANCH AT LOCAL REPOSITORY : git branch -d <branch_name> 

	$ git branch -d calc-divide
	Deleted branch calc-divide (was ecb9b86).

	$ git branch -a
	* master
  	remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  	remotes/origin/calc-divide
  	remotes/origin/master

	Since,calc-divide has been deleted from local repository but not yet from
	remote repository.

	DELETE A BRANCH AT REMOTE REPOSITORY : git push origin --delete <branch_name>

	$ git push origin --delete calc-divide
	To https://github.com/shubhamrocks888/python_practise.git
 	- [deleted]         calc-divide
